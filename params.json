You can see a running instance of it at\r\n[jamur2nes](http://jamur2nes.appspot.com), although I highly recommend if you have the\r\ntechnical know-how, you set up your own instance.  This is for a couple\r\nreasons:\r\n\r\n- The authenticated feeds support is really sketchy, in that you have\r\n  to send Jamur2nes your password to the feeds for it to make requests\r\n  on your behalf.  Further, it makes no effort to encrypt the passwords\r\n  even when at rest.  This is a hobby project after all.  I don't want\r\n  to know your passwords, so don't tell them to me if you can avoid it\r\n  (Most podcasts are not authenticated, so for the vast majority of\r\n  podcasts this isn't an issue).\r\n\r\n- More selfishly, this is a resource-intensive application on Google App\r\n  Engine due to lots of background processing of periodic fetches.  If you\r\n  can run a personal instance of your own on Google's free tier, it's a\r\n  win-win for all of us.\r\n\r\nThose disclaimers aside, this is now my primary podcast client, and it\r\nis my preferred way to consume long-form audio and video podcast content.\r\nEnjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Issues\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- Podcasts hosted on Cachefly do not play correctly.  This is due to the fact\r\n  that Chrome is very finnicky about Content-Length headers, and Cachefly\r\n  doesn't set them correctly.\r\n\r\n- Long videos (> 1 hour) may not play correctly.  I'm not sure what causes\r\n  this, but it seems like a bug in how large files are loaded.\r\n\r\n- Since playback relies entirely on the ``<audio>`` and ``<video>`` tags, you\r\n  are at the whim of your browser for supported codecs.  I recommend Chrome,\r\n  but even Chrome doesn't support AAC playback.\r\n\r\n\r\nSetup\r\n-----\r\n\r\nJamur2nes uses [buildout](http://buildout.org/) to manage its\r\ninstallation in a development environment..  Once you have that installed,\r\nit's a matter of running the following from your checkout's directory::\r\n\r\n    $ buildout bootstrap --distribute\r\n    $ bin/buildout\r\n\r\nTo install (note, the `--distribute` is important, due to a bug in one of\r\nour dependencies).\r\n\r\nTo run a local instance, run::\r\n\r\n    $ bin/dev_appserver parts/feedreader\r\n\r\nFor more detailed instructions on configuration and deployment, see\r\n[rod.recipe.appengine](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/rod.recipe.appengine),\r\nthe configuration tool used to integrate buildout with App Engine.\r\n","name":"Jamur2nes","tagline":"HTML5 podcast client running on Google App Engine"}
