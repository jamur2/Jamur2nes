<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Entirely web-based, no client required</li>
<li>Supports audio and video; the only limit is what your browser supports</li>
<li>Pause on one machine and resume on another: Perfect for long-form audio</li>
<li>Supports authenticated feeds</li>
</ul><h2>About</h2>

<p>This project is a personal itch-scratcher for me, in that I wanted to play
around on Google App Engine, and I couldn't find a podcast client that
matched all my needs.  You can see a running instance of it at
<a href="http://jamur2nes.appspot.com">jamur2nes</a>, although I highly recommend if you have the
technical know-how, you set up your own instance.  This is for a couple
reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The authenticated feeds support is really sketchy, in that you have
to send Jamur2nes your password to the feeds for it to make requests
on your behalf.  Further, it makes no effort to encrypt the passwords
even when at rest.  This is a hobby project after all.  I don't want
to know your passwords, so don't tell them to me if you can avoid it
(Most podcasts are not authenticated, so for the vast majority of
podcasts this isn't an issue).</p></li>
<li><p>More selfishly, this is a resource-intensive application on Google App
Engine due to lots of background processing of periodic fetches.  If you
can run a personal instance of your own on Google's free tier, it's a
win-win for all of us.</p></li>
</ul><p>Those disclaimers aside, this is now my primary podcast client, and it
is my preferred way to consume long-form audio and video podcast content.
Enjoy.</p>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Podcasts hosted on Cachefly do not play correctly.  This is due to the fact
that Chrome is very finnicky about Content-Length headers, and Cachefly
doesn't set them correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>Long videos (&gt; 1 hour) may not play correctly.  I'm not sure what causes
this, but it seems like a bug in how large files are loaded.</p></li>
<li><p>Since playback relies entirely on the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tags, you
are at the whim of your browser for supported codecs.  I recommend Chrome,
but even Chrome doesn't support AAC playback.</p></li>
</ul><h2>Setup</h2>

<p>Jamur2nes uses <a href="http://buildout.org/">buildout</a> to manage its
installation in a development environment..  Once you have that installed,
it's a matter of running the following from your checkout's directory::</p>

<pre><code>$ buildout bootstrap --distribute
$ bin/buildout
</code></pre>

<p>To install (note, the <code>--distribute</code> is important, due to a bug in one of
our dependencies).</p>

<p>To run a local instance, run::</p>

<pre><code>$ bin/dev_appserver parts/feedreader
</code></pre>

<p>For more detailed instructions on configuration and deployment, see
<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/rod.recipe.appengine">rod.recipe.appengine</a>,
the configuration tool used to integrate buildout with App Engine.</p>
